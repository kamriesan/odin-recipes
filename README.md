In this part I'm  primarily learning how to use git with the linux terminal for version control.

# Remember to copy the SSH code first from the github repository when creating a local directory using "git clone"

<h2> Quick Notes </h2>
1. Make sure to be in the correct destination using pwd
2. cd to change directory
3. cd.. to move up to a file tree

<h2> Git Workflow on Linux </h2>
4. git status to check status
5. git add <filename> to add a file to staging area
6. git log to see entries commits
7. code .  or code <filename> to open file directory in VSC 
8. git commit -m "Text here" to add a description for the commit

Push to GitHub
9. git push or git push origin main 

You're done!
